once u start the application bootstarp file is

					   |how to divide the content how to store based on file extension or based on priorities is called pattern 					   


Complete front end with angular 
features how to use that 
when to use that 


v8->google chrome 
spider monkey 


ryan dahl created node js 

he created a javascript server 

vue,react,next,silt,angular 
Express ->backend node server middle ware pipe line 
react ->its not framework javascript library it uses virtual dom 
type node and write console.log("Hello world")
library->pick whichever function and plugin collection of builtin methods and arrange it build structure according  to u 
framework->fit into the structure easier and 	

	angular ->single page application 
loads only a single page document only part required is refreshed 
part of tree is refreshed 
https->protocol
.io->domain
/tutorial->folder

updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs

Es6 -->ecma international standard

javascript is implementation of java script 	

after ecma6 they started with year like ecma 2023
what is statically typed and dynamically typed
-->statically we declare every variables separately like int 
java is strongly typed language each datatype follow certain rules casting implicitly 
python,c is weakly typed [int a =4.5] output 4 -->interpreted 

compiler --compile(check all the errors)->interpreted--->binary

problems faced with var  
var a =10; typeof a->number reassign a = 'hello' typeofa ->string 
//same for let datatype changes 
it is dynamically typed as it is checking the data type at run time 

***
data hoisting //if multiple declaration  there last one is pulled up 
/Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations
 to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
var->
let ->not allow for data hoisting 
const->

var and let 
local varaibles scope is inside not outside

if  u declare a var inside block statement not function 
then u can access it 
{var b1 =45 } 
b1 //45 
same thing if u do with let it shows error 
dont use var it will give wrong results use let instead


difference between const and let 
const ar=[1,2,3,4];
ar=[11,12,13] // error assignment to constant vraiable

ar[0]=111 //works fine
structure only will be apllied only  once 

const person ={name :'Alice',age:60}
person.age =60

data stored in stack || heap 

the stack holds the address manipultating same no problem 
if u create new one it will not point to other 

//javascript object and metjods 
developer.mozilla.org

built in functions explore 

with angular the language that we use is typescript 
typescript is superset of javascript 
type script is strongly typed programming language 
that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale

//data cohersion at run time 
js try to 
Type Coercion refers to the process of 
automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another

ex:-var h = "1"
	type of h ->string 
h +4 //it should not happen but it will do because 


transpilation converting one type of code to other 

angular has type script compiler 
ts-->tsc--->js---javascript--->browser //this process transpilation 
annotate the data at compile time 
type annotation // name :string age : int 

create a standalone compiler 
but in already u already have all of these 


in typescript need to specify data type but for js no need 
check data type errors 

****
type script provides type union which specify set of types as single type 
resolved by string | number 

A union type describes a value 
that can be one of several types. 
We use the vertical bar (|) to separate each type,
 so number | string | boolean is the type of a value 
that can be a number, a string, or a boolean.


//type narrowing //type assertion s
a type is asserted using a keyword follwed by required type 

//no null assertion we can null remove from th etype union 
//price! : number  -> definite assignment assertion 
let toDisplay : true;
!toDisplay 
negation true means false false means true 
//type 

in javascript
modules 
angular ->declare modules and integrate  
declare module u need decorator 
A Decorator is a special kind of declaration 
that can be attached to a class declaration, method, 
accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the 
form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a 
function that will be called at runtime with information
 about the decorated declaration.
ngmodules
modularity ->different into small managble chunks 

divide team declare members finance it 
imports wherever required 
exports '''''''''''''''''
bootstrap module 
module and integrate 
meta data in form of decorator 
*******
components -->piece of code 

to  create ui elements i need component 
but component is part of module so in that i specify what are components in it 

when u create it will have root 

cd todo
package>is a config file which have all dependencies and information about project and scripts that u will be run
tsconfig>config file for ts compiler varaibles and all

npm start 
browser application bundle generation complete 
ts to js happens
all js files bundled 

in index.html 
approot is bootstrap 
in that app.component.html is there 

main.ts contains bootstrao module app module
in that we specify declarations import 

Decorators are a design pattern that is used to separate 
modification or decoration of a class without modifying the 
original source code. In AngularJS, decorators are functions 
that allow a service, directive or filter to be modified prior
 to its usage. 


ng generate component <component-name>
ng g c todo/todoDisplay



Data Binding 
square bracket [] has
property of html element

component to view one way binding html 

pass data in on edirection component ->html 

explore javascript methods
how to access member of a java script 
classes methods accessing objects 
explore and understand 

import arrays
export 
bootstrap components 
modules ng modules
component metadata->selector identify of compinent and providees
location of ui and class contains business logic 


we learnt data binding string interpolation 
passing from component to html
